### How Itâ€™s Made
In this project I created variables , event listeners and functions that all played a role in developing this game.
It was so cool to watch functions be initiated by event listeners when they were clicked on. When you click on either button , which are rock paper or scissors
the game will notify you who won and display the message "Winner Winner Chicken Dinner" or "Sorry, you're a loser"
as it also logged the point of human player and bot (computer).
** Langs used **
HTML , Javascript & CSS

### Lessons Learned
In this lesson I learned how to recall certain functions to make code shorter.
Manipulating the Dom to display a message in the inner HTML element its ID was assigned to.
